  <h1>A Little About Myself</h1>
  <p class="about">My name is Sonya Lennox, I have two different careers which are Graphic Design and Web Development. I started at Sait right out of High School in the 2 year Graphic Communcations and Print Technology Program where I learned how to use Photoshop, Indesign, Illustrator, Wordpress, Adobe Acrobat DC and preparing documents start to finish to get printed out. In the program it wasn't all just computer based you also go to learn how to work printers which would usually consist of putting the ink on the rollers, putting the plates on that are being used for that project, printing the plates out, setting the machine up for printing and printing the final product out. In the program you also got the chance to learn basic HTML and CSS to create a website which was then followed up by creating your own website which required choosing the right domain and hosting for the website to use.</p>
  <p class="about">After completing the Graphic Communnications and Print Technology Program I decided to pursue my interest of the start to finish process of creating a website and applied for the Fast-Track 23 week Web Development program offered at SAIT. During this program we got to learn how to create a website from start to finish through the use of HTML, CSS ,Javascript as well as Wordpress.</p>
